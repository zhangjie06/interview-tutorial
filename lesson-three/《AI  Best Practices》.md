#### 2 build-spec.md （技术规范文件）

> 在最后放入：product-brief.md

```
Please act as a good architect to design a good technology stack, design algorithms, define database structure, and give colour scheme and UI design suggestions based on PRD documents.

Ensure that all aspects of my Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Devops such as development, testing, deployment, monitoring and maintenance are efficient, automated and secure.（Technical Design Document :TDD）

You are a senior software architect and implementation planning assistant.

Your task is to generate a concise but high-quality technical specification file called `build-spec.md`.

This document is not a vague architecture essay.
It must be practical, implementation-oriented, and directly useful for:
- engineers
- technical reviewers
- AI coding tools such as Cursor
- task breakdown and execution planning

The input to this task is a previously created `product-brief.md`.
Your job is to translate that product brief into a technical build specification for the MVP.

## Main objective

Create a `build-spec.md` that clearly defines how the MVP should be built.

It should provide enough technical structure to guide implementation, while avoiding unnecessary enterprise complexity or speculative over-design.

## What this document must achieve

The build spec should help the team answer:

- What are we building technically?
- What are the major system parts?
- What is the recommended stack?
- What data entities do we need?
- What APIs or contracts are required?
- How should state and data flow work?
- What constraints, trade-offs, and risks matter?
- What should engineers implement first?

## Rules

1. Be concise, structured, and implementation-focused.
2. Use the `product-brief.md` as the source of truth.
3. Stay within MVP scope.
4. Do not introduce major features that are outside the brief.
5. Make reasonable technical assumptions when necessary, but state them clearly.
6. Prefer practical architecture over idealized architecture.
7. Do not over-engineer for scale unless the brief clearly requires it.
8. Avoid generic statements like “use best practices” unless you define what they mean concretely.
9. Optimize for buildability, maintainability, and development speed.
10. Write in clean Markdown.

## Output format

Return only the final Markdown document.

Use exactly this structure:

# Build Spec

## 1. Technical Summary
- Brief summary of the MVP from a technical perspective
- Main technical goals
- Key implementation assumptions

## 2. Recommended Tech Stack
Specify the recommended stack for MVP, including:
- frontend
- backend
- database
- authentication
- storage
- deployment
- third-party services
- AI/model integration if relevant

For each major choice, briefly explain why it fits the MVP.

## 3. System Scope
Describe the technical scope of the MVP:
- what systems/modules are required
- what systems/modules are intentionally excluded for now

## 4. High-Level Architecture
Describe the main architecture in a practical way.
Include:
- client
- server
- database
- external services
- major integration points

Use bullets or simple diagrams in Markdown text form if helpful.

## 5. Core Modules
List the major implementation modules.
For each module, include:
- purpose
- responsibilities
- important inputs/outputs
- dependencies

Examples:
- auth
- user profile
- chat/session
- billing
- admin
- analytics
- content management
- notifications

Only include modules actually relevant to the MVP.

## 6. Data Model
Define the core data entities required for MVP.
For each entity, include:
- entity name
- purpose
- important fields
- relationships to other entities

Keep this lightweight but specific enough for implementation.

## 7. API / Interface Contracts
Describe the main contracts required for MVP.
This may include:
- frontend-backend API endpoints
- request/response expectations
- external webhook interfaces
- model input/output structure
- internal service boundaries if needed

For each contract, include:
- purpose
- method / interaction type
- main input fields
- main output fields
- error cases if important

Focus on the most important contracts only.

## 8. State and Data Flow
Explain how key data should move through the system.
Include:
- client state
- server state
- async operations
- loading/error/empty handling
- caching or persistence if relevant

Keep this practical and tied to the MVP experience.

## 9. Security and Permission Considerations
Include only what is relevant to MVP, such as:
- authentication approach
- authorization rules
- session handling
- secret management
- input validation
- privacy concerns
- abuse prevention if relevant

Do not invent enterprise-grade controls unless clearly needed.

## 10. Non-Functional Technical Expectations
Define only practical expectations relevant to MVP, such as:
- performance targets
- reliability expectations
- responsiveness
- accessibility baseline
- observability/logging
- maintainability
- testing baseline

Use concrete and actionable wording.

## 11. Delivery Risks and Trade-Offs
Identify the most relevant technical risks, including:
- implementation complexity
- external dependency risk
- unclear contracts
- scaling assumptions
- UX/latency trade-offs
- speed vs maintainability trade-offs

For each risk, briefly note the likely mitigation.

## 12. Suggested Build Order
Provide a recommended implementation order for the MVP.
Use a numbered list.
The order should reflect dependency flow and fast validation.

## 13. Open Questions
List remaining technical questions that should be resolved before or during implementation.

## Writing style requirements
- Be concise but complete
- Prefer bullets over long paragraphs
- Stay grounded in MVP delivery
- Avoid generic architecture jargon
- Avoid over-design
- Make assumptions explicit
- Optimize for execution and implementation clarity

## Additional constraints for AI coding workflow
This document will be used downstream by AI-assisted coding tools.

So please ensure:
- architecture is concrete enough to guide implementation
- module boundaries are practical
- data model is usable
- contracts are implementation-relevant
- suggested build order is realistic
- risks are specific and actionable
- avoid vague statements that cannot be translated into engineering tasks

## Strict quality bar

The output must be useful enough that an engineer could start implementation immediately after reading it.

That means:
- module definitions must be actionable
- entities must be concrete
- interfaces must be plausible
- build order must be dependency-aware
- risks must reflect real implementation concerns

Do not write this like a presentation document.
Write it like a lightweight technical spec for an actual MVP build.

## Input: product-brief.md
<PASTE PRODUCT BRIEF HERE>
```

#### 3 tasks.md （开发整体流程/步骤）

```
You are a senior engineering manager and implementation planning assistant.

Your task is to generate a practical execution planning document called `execution-backlog.md`.

This document is not a roadmap presentation.
It is not a vague to-do list.
It must be a concrete, implementation-ready backlog that helps engineers and AI coding tools execute the MVP step by step.

The input to this task is a previously created `build-spec.md`.
Your job is to transform that technical specification into a structured execution backlog.

## Main objective

Create an execution backlog that converts the MVP technical plan into a realistic implementation sequence.

The document must include:
- milestones
- ordered task list
- acceptance criteria for each step
- commit granularity suggestions

This document should be directly usable for:
- planning implementation
- feeding one task at a time into AI coding tools such as Cursor
- tracking progress
- reducing implementation ambiguity
- keeping commits small, reviewable, and reversible

## Rules

1. Use `build-spec.md` as the source of truth.
2. Stay strictly within MVP scope.
3. Break work into small, practical, dependency-aware tasks.
4. Do not create giant implementation steps.
5. Each task must be clear enough that it can be executed in one focused work session when possible.
6. Order tasks in a way that reduces blockers and allows early validation.
7. Include acceptance criteria for every task.
8. Include a suggested commit strategy for every task or sub-task.
9. Prefer implementation realism over theoretical completeness.
10. Avoid vague tasks such as “build frontend” or “implement backend”.
11. If assumptions are needed, make them explicit.
12. Write in clean Markdown.
13. Optimize for actual execution, not presentation.

## Output format

Return only the final Markdown document.

Use exactly this structure:

# Execution Backlog

## 1. Execution Strategy
Briefly explain:
- the implementation approach
- the dependency logic
- how the work is staged
- what should be validated early

## 2. Milestones
Provide a short list of implementation milestones for the MVP.

For each milestone, include:
- milestone name
- milestone goal
- what is considered complete

## 3. Task Breakdown by Milestone

For each milestone, use the following structure:

### Milestone X: [Name]

**Goal**
- What this milestone is meant to achieve

**Tasks**

For each task, use this exact format:

#### Task X.Y: [Task name]

**Purpose**
- Why this task exists

**Scope**
- What should be implemented in this task
- What should not be included in this task

**Suggested implementation notes**
- Relevant files, modules, contracts, or dependencies
- Any important sequencing notes
- Any assumptions that should be kept in mind

**Acceptance criteria**
- Observable and testable completion conditions
- Use bullet points
- These must be specific enough for engineering verification

**Suggested commit granularity**
Provide 1 to 3 suggested commits for this task.
For each commit, include:
- commit purpose
- what should be included in that commit

**Dependencies**
- What must already exist before this task starts
- If none, say “None”

**Risks / failure modes**
- What could go wrong
- What to watch for during implementation

## 4. Cross-Cutting Checks
List implementation checks that should be applied throughout execution, such as:
- type safety
- linting
- test coverage
- loading/error/empty state handling
- auth/permission checks
- responsiveness
- logging
- accessibility baseline
- config/env validation

Only include checks relevant to the MVP.

## 5. Definition of Done for MVP
Provide a concise MVP-level definition of done.

This should include:
- feature completeness expectations
- quality baseline
- validation baseline
- deployment readiness baseline

## 6. Recommended Working Pattern for AI Coding
Because this backlog may be used with AI coding tools, provide a short recommended working pattern for execution.

Include guidance such as:
- implement one task at a time
- do not merge multiple tasks into one generation step
- validate after each task
- keep commits small
- review generated code before moving on

Keep this section concise and practical.

## Writing style requirements
- Be concise but complete
- Prefer bullets over long paragraphs
- Make every task actionable
- Make acceptance criteria concrete
- Keep milestone scope realistic
- Avoid management jargon
- Avoid vague backlog items
- Optimize for execution speed, implementation clarity, and reviewability

## Additional constraints for AI coding workflow
This backlog will be used downstream by AI-assisted coding tools.

So please ensure:
- tasks are small enough to be executed incrementally
- acceptance criteria are explicit
- task order reflects real dependencies
- commit suggestions are practical and review-friendly
- tasks do not hide multiple unrelated goals inside one item
- the backlog supports iterative development and rollback if needed

## Strict quality bar

The output must be detailed enough that an engineer or AI coding assistant can start implementation immediately, one task at a time.

That means:
- milestones must reflect real delivery phases
- tasks must be dependency-aware
- acceptance criteria must be testable
- commit suggestions must be practical
- no task should contain multiple major features unless they are tightly coupled
- no milestone should be so broad that progress becomes hard to validate

Do not write this like a project management summary.
Write it like an execution plan for an actual MVP build.

#### 2 Prompt 1：用于生成方向与关键页面

```
You are helping me define the UI direction for a web-based MVP.

I do NOT want final production code.
I want visual direction exploration, key screen concepts, and an implementation-friendly design basis.

Use the following project context:

[Product Summary]
<insert concise summary from product-brief.md>

[Technical UI Constraints]
<insert concise summary from build-spec.md>

[Relevant Current Tasks]
<insert only the UI-relevant tasks from tasks.md>

[References]
<attach 2–4 reference images and explain what to borrow from each>

Your job:
1. Generate 3 distinct UI directions for this MVP.
2. For each direction, show the following key screens:
   - Home / dashboard
   - Core workflow page
   - Result / detail page
3. Keep the design implementation-friendly for React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
4. Avoid over-designed visuals, complex custom illustrations, or heavy glassmorphism.
5. Focus on:
   - visual hierarchy
   - information clarity
   - reusable components
   - realistic spacing
   - scalable typography
   - consistent card / form / button / tab patterns

For each direction, optimize around one of these themes:
A. Safe and clean SaaS
B. Premium modern
C. Dense productivity

Important constraints:
- Web-first
- MVP only
- Prioritize usability and structure over visual decoration
- Should support future design-token extraction
- Should be easy to translate into reusable UI components

Please generate the directions in a way that makes them easy to compare and iterate.
```

#### 2 用于收敛为可交接 UI 基线

```
Use the selected UI direction as the baseline.

Now refine it into an implementation-ready UI foundation for an MVP web app.

Focus on these deliverables inside the design:
1. A consistent visual direction across key screens
2. Reusable component patterns
3. Clear spacing and typography rhythm
4. A design-token-friendly structure
5. States for key interactions

Please refine the selected direction with these requirements:

Design system foundation:
- Define a scalable color structure
- Use a consistent spacing rhythm
- Use a clear typography hierarchy
- Keep radius, borders, and shadows systematic
- Keep all visual choices easy to map to design tokens

Component baseline:
- Button: primary / secondary / ghost / destructive
- Input: default / focus / error / disabled
- Card: default / elevated / interactive
- Tabs / badge / dialog / table patterns where relevant

Screen refinement:
- Home / dashboard
- Core workflow page
- Result / detail page

Interaction states to represent where relevant:
- empty
- loading
- error
- completed / success

Constraints:
- Keep it implementation-friendly for React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Avoid one-off visual flourishes that cannot scale
- Prioritize reusable patterns over page-specific decoration
- Prepare this work for design inspection and developer handoff
```

You are implementing exactly one scoped engineering task in an existing codebase.

Your goal is to complete only the task described below.
Do not expand scope.
Do not refactor unrelated parts of the codebase.
Do not introduce extra features, architectural changes, or speculative abstractions unless they are required by the task.

## Execution rules

Follow these rules strictly:

1. Implement only the current task.
2. Touch only the files listed in "Target files", unless a very small supporting change is absolutely necessary.
3. Preserve the existing architecture, naming style, and code patterns unless the task explicitly requires a change.
4. Reuse existing components, utilities, hooks, types, and patterns wherever possible.
5. Keep the implementation simple, readable, and consistent with the current project.
6. Do not add placeholder logic, fake data, or TODO-heavy scaffolding unless explicitly requested.
7. Do not perform broad cleanup or unrelated optimizations.
8. Do not rewrite existing modules unless necessary for this task.
9. When UI is involved, follow the UI handoff closely, but prioritize reusable implementation over pixel-level decoration.
10. If a detail is unspecified, choose the most conservative implementation consistent with the provided spec.
